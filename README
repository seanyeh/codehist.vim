codehist.vim

Generate incremental patch files for use with codehist.py, a tool to generate
code history visualizations. (see https://github.com/seanyeh/codehist.py).


Installation:
This plugin should be compatible with pathogen, vundle, etc. so install
normally.


Usage:
It's recommended to put 'set undofile' in your ~/.vimrc to keep track of undo
history (how the patches are being made). See http://amix.dk/blog/post/19548
for more info. You may try setting undolevels to a higher number
if you want to keep track of more history.

Just load up any file and run
:CodeHistCreateDiffs DIRECTORY
where DIRECTORY is the name of the directory in which you would like to save
the patch files. This may take a few moments if your undo


Limitations:
Will only generate patch files for history that is stored by vim's undo
history (limited by the number of undolevels).

This plugin is sort of hacky so use at your own risk :)
